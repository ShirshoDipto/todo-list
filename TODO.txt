I love Shusme. But she doesn't love me as much as I do. 
And she has no idea how much I can love her.
But she doesn't love me much. 
What more do I say?
She also rolls on the bed too much. 
Doesn't listen to me.
No She does listen to me. HOW SWEET! It's really sweet. 
Today I will talk to her perhaps.
